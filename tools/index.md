# Code
Our code&mdash;including the code for this website&mdash;is hosted on our [lab Github](https://github.com/Lindsay-Lab).

DynVision, our toolbox for building dynamically realistic recurrent convolutional neural networks, is [here](https://github.com/Lindsay-Lab/DynVision/). 

# Learning Resources

## CompNeuro and NeuroAI

[Neuromatch Academy](https://neuromatch.io/open-education-resources/) runs live virtual courses over the summer (which includes a research component) and also has their course materials (videos and code) free online for anyone to work through. Courses include Computational Neuroscience, Deep Learning, and NeuroAI. It also has some introductory Python tutorials.

[Models of the Mind: How Physics, Engineering, and Mathematics Have Shaped Our Understanding of the Brain](https://bookshop.org/p/books/models-of-the-mind-how-physics-engineering-and-mathematics-have-shaped-our-understanding-of-the-brain-grace-lindsay/14108b00c91f38b3?ean=9781472966438&next=t&) is a popular science book by Grace that covers how and why math and modeling are used to study the brain. You can probably find it in a library.

[Brain-Inspired](https://braininspired.co/) is a podcast where Paul Middlebrooks interviews a lot of professors and researchers about their work on NeuroAI and computational neuroscience. 

[VVTNS](https://www.youtube.com/@theoreticalneuroscience6062) is a weekly digital seminar on Zoom targeting the theoretical neuroscience community. They host talks by professors on YouTube. 

[NeuroAI papers](https://github.com/CYHSM/awesome-neuro-ai-papers) is a list of NeuroAI research papers and reviews.

[The Transmitter](https://www.thetransmitter.org/) is a publication by and for neuroscientists. While not focused specifically on computational approaches, it frequently includes articles about them. 

## Climate Change + AI

[5 Minute Papers on AI for the Planet](https://www.youtube.com/@AIforthePlanet) is Grace's YouTube channel covering academic papers that apply machine learning to problems related to climate, ecology, etc.

[Climate Change AI](https://www.climatechange.ai/) is an organization that hosts workshops and resources on using AI towards Climate Change problems. It also hosted a virtual [summer school](https://www.youtube.com/@ClimateChangeAI/playlists).

[The Climate Code](https://the-climate-code.beehiiv.com/) is a newsletter and collection of documents and resources about AI + Environment. 

Neuromatch has a course on [computational climate science](https://neuromatch.io/computational-tools-for-climate-science-course/). 

["So you're an academic who wants to help with the climate crisis?"](https://gracewlindsay.com/2023/08/04/so-youre-an-academic-who-wants-to-help-with-the-climate-crisis/) - A blog post with general advice and resources by Grace 

[Slides on Career Paths for Climate](https://lindsay-lab.github.io/ClimateML_Lectures/climatecareer.pdf) - used in Grace's Machine Learning for Climate Course
