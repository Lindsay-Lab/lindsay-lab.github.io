# Modeling attention with artificial neural networks

{% capture text %}
Attention as a term is widely-used yet remains difficult to define productively. A common feature across different concepts of attention, however, is its ability to impact behavior, usually in a positive way. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are a smart choice for exploring the neural mechanisms of attention because ANNs use populations of neurons to perform challenging tasks. Therefore, they can be used to explore how changes in neural activity associated with attention can cause
