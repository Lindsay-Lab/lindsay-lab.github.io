**Position**: Postdoc in the Lindsay Lab at the Center for Data Science at New York University
**Duration**: 2 years

The Lindsay Lab is hiring a postdoc for a project on “attention” in large Vision-Language Models. Here, attention refers to the ability to flexibly guide sensory processing (not the specific Transformer mechanism). [See more here](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/computational-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00029/full). The broad goal of this project is to study attentional capacities and limitations in VLMs using methods and concepts from neuroscience and psychology. Outcomes of this work will include: identification of strengths and weaknesses in VLMs, comparisons between human and VLM attention, and a potential re-evaluation of how attention is characterized and studied in these fields.

The ideal candidate will have a PhD in Psychology, Neuroscience, Computer Science, or a related field. They will have a demonstrated interest in the study of sensory processing and/or attention and will have worked with and understand the architectures of various VLMs. Exceptional candidates without a PhD will be considered if they have equivalent research experience. 

To express interest, send an email to <grace.lindsay@nyu.edu> (subject line “VLM Postdoc Position”) with your CV and a research statement (~2 pages) describing the style of work you would like to do at this intersection and how your past work prepares you for this.
This position is funded through support from [Longview Philanthropy](https://www.longview.org/) and will have a salary of ~72,000 USD.
